So today I decided to make a little timeline. I like posting stuff about this beloved website, but simply don't know whether to post it on Fedi or make a post about it here. As of writing, [#dev](/tags/dev/) has the most posts (9), but [#meta](/tags/meta/) is a running second (6). Surely there's got to be some place for all this meta without making actual posts on `/posts/`?

Recently, I got an interest for places like [tilde.club](https://tilde.club). I was browsing around some people's personal sites there and they're mostly timelines that just explain the status quo — a literal *web log*!

It excited me. I already signed up for an account there, but unfortunately I haven't recieved any updates, so I'm back to here. Perhaps I will make the über-long page right here in my site then! 

So yeah, this is the first log here. Hello.

Wait, I was gonna address something here before I did `hugo new content timeline.md`. Hmm, what was it?
