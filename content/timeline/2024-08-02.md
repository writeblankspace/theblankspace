Earlier today I had something of an emotional breakdown. Guess what ultimately calmed me down? The thought of having to fix this website's RSS feed! Strange, perhaps even dumb and superficial, I know. But something's so comforting about computers and programs. There's almost *always* a solution. It's *always* simple-minded and somewhat predictable. Unlike people.

The problems feel more concrete and solvable. The variables are plentiful, but limited. There's something comforting about that that makes me want to live the moment and stop thinking about all the bad things in life. Computers are amazing.
