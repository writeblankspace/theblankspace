So my last post was 4 days ago. I guess there was *no* pattern.

Anyways, I'm done with my portfolio website! Yay! I suppose that means I can chill now and doomscroll or whatever again... it's quite bittersweet, actually. Just like this website.

No more new features to add. No more things to expect. I can find some other hobby that doesn't require staring at a screen and mumbling to myself about the weirdness — or the greatness — of CSS, and HTML, and static site generators.

There's *always* still work to do. But not right now.

It was nice.

So now, I can just write random blog posts for either this website or that. I heard that having a blog is good for people looking at your portfolio. I suppose there's some logic there that I'm not very bothered to parse right now.

So yeah. It's chill. Bittersweet. Whatever. Signing off for now.
