**Content Warning**: sarcasm and unhingedness. Proceed with caution. Also a ridiculous amount of "I"s for starting paragraphs. Clearly this demonstrates my superior and diverse vocabulary!

I've been busy yesterday. I managed to fix some links and fix the lastmod date of all the posts (they all ended up showing "Edited 02 Aug 2024" after I fixed the folder structure, which is *totally* helpful), but then I had to go to the city and not much was done then.

I also began to dream about making a new theme for this website, as I initially wanted it to be minimal and use as little resources as possible. That went well into midnight, when I decided to write up a [specification for how to choose colours and implement the theme](https://github.com/writeblankspace/reallyCooNiceVibrantColourScheme) â€” hyperfocus, anyone?

I actually got to implementing that theme on this very site... until I went, *hold on a second*. I *loved* the site as it is! Its beautiful, minimal monochrome. As I tried to get the tags to look nicer, I realised how beautiful my site already was, without some fancy dark mode theme.

I probably do need to fix the `line-height` and `font-size` though, because HTML defaults for those are just kinda ew. Oh, and turns out I can centre divs without `flex`, so maybe I should get rid it in favour of `margin: auto`.
