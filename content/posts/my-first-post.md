I'm just starting out and making this cool new Hugo website as a blog teehee. This is called My First Post because that's what the quickstart told me to call it :D.

If this post appears a little weird to you, I suggest changing either your browser (get out Internet Explorer) or your browser's default sans serif font. I made this website as minimal as possible while still adding my own flair to it. Still looks weird and you think it's my fault? ~~No u.~~ Send me a message on mastodon ([writeblankspace@infosec.space](https://infosec.space/@writeblankspace)) and I'll see what I did or did not do wrong.

Cheers!
