You managed to [set up MelonDS on desktop](../transferring-saves-to-melonds/). Now for the exciting bit: using local multiplayer!

Local multiplayer allows you to run several instances of MelonDS and essentially emulate a link between those instances — as if you have two NDSes actually connected to each other!

It's really useful when you want to trade Pokémon, hehe.

1. Navigate to **System > Multiplayer**
2. Select **Launch new instance**
3. Set up the new window like you would to open up your ROM/savefile

You're ready to go!
