I love it when somebody talks about something (a hobby or some other passion) they genuinely love. I don't know, but there's this quality to the way they would talk about it, even if they don't use extravagant words.

Hence, I love the phrase "waxing poetic": *to talk about something with such passion that the language is becoming increasingly verbose*. A person waxing poetic about *anything* — that's freaking poetry to me.

Even if I don't care about, say, volleyball, when I hear someone talk about anything about volleyball and sound like they could go on for hours — if only I could bottle up all that inspiring passion in the world!

Because I have my passions too; sometimes it's music, sometimes it's random language facts or analyses of literary works, right now it's something to do with websites, sometimes it's something about character arcs or whatever. I can wax poetic on those for *hours*. So when I hear, or read, or whatever, someone just wax poetic about *their* passions, I can't help but be in awe: *that person is as dedicated to their art as I am about mine!* It's beautiful.

It's also why I think any passion can be called an 'art'. If you're passionate enough about sport, it's almost a performance, an art. If you're passionate enough about mechanical stuff, the thing you made is a masterpiece. If you're passionate enough about that one paragraph you wrote yapping about some weird hobby — *that is art*. And I freaking love art, when passion simply pours out of it.
