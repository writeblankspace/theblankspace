There are *tons* of articles written about this thing called the Fediverse. I dunno, I haven't read many of them but of course I would *love* to saturate them even further with my (probably unindexed) takes on the Fediverse.

They're mostly stuff I wrote specifically for my friends. If you think there's anything wrong here, feel free to contact me on my socials.
