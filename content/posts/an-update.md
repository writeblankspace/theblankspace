Hi. Let's see, my last post here was back in 28 Jan 2024. It's been four months!

I just finished polishing it up yesterday with some minor design changes. With the publish of this post, I got rid of a lot of cringy unhinged text on the main pages. The posts remain unchanged except for an update on my Fediverse handle.

As of right now, Fedirings  aren't working. For some reason my emails never end up making the issue on their tracker. Oh well.

So yeah. I finished my iGCSEs just last week, which meant I was finally able to do all the configuring I needed to do on my laptop and get to polishing this website up. And it's done. Yay!

I hope I get to add more posts here soon.
