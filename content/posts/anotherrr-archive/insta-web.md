(this doesn't use any extensions nor the Instagram API)

1.  go to Instagram
2.  right click > `Inspect element`
3.  click on the phone symbol `ðŸ“±` on the upper-right to toggle the toolbar
4.  on the upper-left, you will see a button called `Responsive ðŸ”½`
5.  choose a phone brand (eg. `iPhone X`)
6.  the page should refresh automatically
7.  you can now use Instagram web as if on phone

There _are_ some cons to using this method. It wouldn't be like using the Instagram app on phone, so you couldn't post carousels nor make multiple stories, or other functionalities.
