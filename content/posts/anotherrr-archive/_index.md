I used to have this website called [anotherrr.web.app](https://anotherrr.web.app). Why are there so many 'r's, you ask? Because I thought calling it "another.web.app" would be quite funny, but that was taken. So I called it "another random read"... "anotherrr" for short.

The last time I touched it was in 2022. Imagine! But the time I actually used it was back when I was 14 (2021). I loved this website.

It was made using a Static Site Generator... made by me, in Python. Yes, I tried to reinvent the wheel. That resulted in spaghetti code.

For some reason, all my posts disappeared from the actual website now. You'll still be able to get a glimpse of the site in its former glory from [the internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210823070621/https://anotherrr.web.app/)... I'm scrolling through it right now and I can't help but think, I really put in so much effort in there, huh?

However, going through the Internet Archive isn't the most reliable nor the fastest. So I decided to put all these old posts right here, in their new home. It doesn't have all the old fancy CSS, but the content is copy-pasted straight from 2021. Enjoy!

**NOTE: these posts may contain several images and syntax-highlighted code snippets, so it's definitely a little heavier than my usual posts here.**
