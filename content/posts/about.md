I dunno who'd be interested enough to view this page — or heck, even this website — but if you truly are curious then feel free to scroll through all this meta stuff. 

Read on if you'd like to learn more about...

### ...yours truly, a.k.a. me

Heyy I usually go about the username writeblankspace (seemed a really cool username, like "write" and then a blank space where I could write stuff — also Blank Space teehee) but you might find that I tend to change my display name. I like being anonymous 'cause why not? It feels nicer.

I'm interested in a ton of things. I like music, programming, and the visual arts. I often end up in rabbit holes about mythology, linguistics or personality stuff (like personality taxonomies, such as 16personalities, cognitive functions and SortingHatChats). You can say I'm a Jack of all trades, master of none - but better than master of one (hopefully!). Oh... and Taylor Swift. A lot of Taylor Swift. And some other artists too...

Anyways, stuff tends to be unhinged around here. Unhinged or I would give you so much info your brain will just shut down. Like I like to say: don't say I didn't warn ya.

When I'm not unhinged nor infodumping nor ranting or whatever, I'm just bored. A bored 2007 girlie. Can you blame me?

I speak English (mainly) and Tagalog (natively) but you might see me trying out some French because iGCSEs.

### ...the website

This website is a lovely place where my brain cells go to rest. It was made with GoHugo and the produced website is static.

The main things I want to achieve with this website:

1. **Function**. It has to show all my posts. That's done.
2. **No bloat**. I am someone who prefers aesthetics over certain things, but why not be aesthetic *and* effective? I tried my best to make sure the CSS does the bare minimum to make a nice website without going into animations and custom stuff and whatnot. The fonts I use here are your locally-stored fonts (check your browser's font settings). Also, I don't wish to add any JavaScript on here. Probably never will. At least I don't have to pretend I know how that works.
3. **Looks *me***. I like this thing to reflect *me*. I like the colour scheme. I like the minimal timeline that doesn't need super fancy marquees or whatever. I like being able to do all of the above.

Wanna see the source code of the website? Head to its [GitHub page](https://github.com/writeblankspace/theblankspace). If there are any issues, go ahead and make some. Take heed: I may not see it for the next 6 months. Or ever. Y'know, so you're aware. If you wanna look at the code, even use it, go ahead. I hope you like spaghetti — the sweet kind, mind, 'cause I'm Filipino.

### ...whatever else

I dunno I think you got the gist of it. And really if you wanna know more about me or this website, I suggest you just go around and see stuff for yourself. I change all the time — I like to say I'm like the weather, and I've heard that a nice adjective for myself is 'mercurial' (I'll leave you to Google that, but I like it because it's a word used in *illicit affairs* by none other than T. A. Swift). This website will reflect that, maybe. Or it will be lost in time in the depths of my filesystem or my GitHub repos or later become data lost in the years since technology... uh, I mean it will just be lost in time. No need to dystopian stuff rn.

Baiiii. Or not. Keep scrolling, if you wish. Or not.
