I dunno who'd be interested enough to view this page — or heck, even this website — but if you truly are curious then feel free to scroll through all this meta stuff. 

Read on if you'd like to learn more about...

### ...yours truly (me)

I usually go about the username writeblankspace (seemed a really cool username, like "write" and then a blank space where I could write stuff — also Blank Space because yeah) but you might find that I tend to change my display name. I like staying anonymous online.

I'm interested in a ton of things. I like music and tech. I often end up in rabbit holes about mythology, linguistics or such. 

My current obsession changes a lot, but I find myself falling back to the same hobbies every so often.

As said by a wise woman once, "Embrace the cringe". I'd like to think that I'm *embracing the cringe*. That might lead to a lot of unhingedness, but in a world that craves perfection (and, in that quest to perfection, misses the entire point), who needs hinges? Be what you are.

My main language is English, but my native tongue is Tagalog. Most (if not all) of the posts on this site are most likely going to be in English.

### ...the website

This website is a lovely place where my brain cells go to rest. It was made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), an amazing static site generator.

The contents and the design of this website are written entirely by me.

The main things I want to achieve with this website:

- **Functionality**: This website is functional and shows all its posts. Yay.
- **No bloat**: I was quite inspired by the [mfing website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/). Websites are responsive and actually quite beautiful by default. Why change that? While I'm not ditching CSS altogether, I aim to stick to the defaults as much as possible and add my own design elements where it improves the look and feel.
- **Accessibility**: There are little things anybody could do to make a website more accessible, whether it's to those with visual impairments, slow internet connection, or whatever.
- **Personalisation**: I [once waxed poetic](../why-i-made-a-website) on how your personal website was a manifestation of yourself, made with your heart and soul. That rings true for me on here. All elements of this websie feel like *me*.

The source code of this website is available on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/writeblankspace/theblankspace). If there are any issues, go ahead and make some. Take heed: I may not see it for the next 6 months. Or ever. Y'know, just so you're aware. 

### ...whatever else

That's essentially all I can tell you about myself and this website without going off on a tangent. If you would like to go down those tangents, view my [posts](/posts/)!

**EDIT 28 Jul 2024: so I edited this page a little bit to reflect my current self. Forgive me if the language seems kind of 'off' because right now you're seeing two different phases of me on a single page. I did say *embrace the cringe* but some parts were just so cringy I had to lop them off. They're immortalised in the older git versions though!**
