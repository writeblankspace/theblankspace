What? Why did you click on that link?

ðŸ¤” I honestly don't know what you think you'll find in here, but it's definitely not what you're looking for. I don't even know why you're bothering to scroll down and read this content, why you're still here reading this very sentence.

Huh, you're insufferable, did you know that? Guess what, I inserted a script in this thing that will crash your computer!

Good luck surviving that. I bet you're still loading and it will never stop until your browser stops.

Any minute now...

No, why would I put those things on my website? 

1. that would crash *my* computer
2. I'm too dumb to make that

Well, here's a trick for you: just add this bit of css to your website:

```css
.loading {
	cursor: wait;
}
```

And any user who hovers over that thing will have a loading cursor! If you inspect the elements here, you'll find an inline CSS in the HTML script making your cursor load. It's not really loading anything. It's just a cursor. But it *does* tend to trigger people.

**NOTE 23 Jul 2024: I was much younger when I wrote this. This was extremely cringe and it will definitely leave you confused. I had put that CSS snippet into the original website, but I am currently too lazy to put it back in. Heh.**
