That image is from Unsplash. It's not mine and I don't drink coffee. I don't use earphones (I prefer listening straight from the speakers) but I do like music. My keyboard is black and I prefer dotted grid notebooks to lined paper.

\*takes a deeps breath\* Yeah, just a disclaimer. You might get the wrong thing about me or something.

## Hobbies!

I think Hobbies mostly define you and the things you like. Well, I have a lot of hobbies. 

You'll find that my biggest hobbies are development (computer programming - don't think of a stereotypical mechanic or a microsoft dev or... I'll explain later), reading and writing, and I read a lot. 

I also enjoy listening to music, especially Taylor Swift, and I can play the guitar and the ukulele.

## Development

Alright, I should probably explain. From everything I've heard, people either think I'm a computer mechanic or a person who types nonstop into a green-and-black screen and hacks random people.

\*Cough cough\* *please*, I'm currently fourteen and those are all *such* stereotypes. I do not fix computers, though my computer might bug every so often and I'll have to fix it myself, but I don't bother with wires. 

Also, green on black hurts. I don't type nonsense into my code editor, thank you very much.

Here's how my editor looks like. This code is part of what makes this website (where I write my articles in markdown and I use templates, variables and functions to customise my website):

As for those who *do* know about development, you'll find that I seem to use Python a lot. I prefer it to JavaScript, for the obvious reason: I'm tired of iteration syntax and semicolons and *so many brackets*. 

I prefer Python, where all you gotta do is use a colon and an indent. It looks nice too.

Speaking of which, you might want to look at this article: [Why Python is better than JavaScript](../why-learn-py).

## Music and literature

Music, poetry, and books. The three best things in the world. I like writing songs, and if I can't write a song, it's going to be a poem. 

I also love literature; I write a lot of stories, especially on Wattpad, although writers' block strikes often and I just give up.

I can play the guitar and the uke as mentioned earlier. I often play Taylor Swift (duh). As of now, I'm still struggling to make my barres sound nice on guitar, but I manage to make it sound even with the buzzing.

As for reading... what else can I say? Proud Potterhead and I'm  becoming a Rick Riordan fan as well.

 I usually like mysteries, and I like teen fantasies (the ones that say fairies are vain, not that they carry wands. Read Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them - it says it all!). 
 
 Good cries and really complicated plots also get me.

Aside from the two major fanbases, I also like Hunger Games (good cries there ToT) and I also read Jacqueline Wilson. 

I used to read lots of Enid Blyton too; they're often childish and unrealistic, but they're entertaining as a whole, especially with mysteries. 

Other stuff I like are Wonder (about a kid with a deformity - it's really good!), Molly Moon (hypnotism is the best) and The Land Of Stories (fairytales in real life, but I've outgrown it).

## Harry Potter and Percy Jackson

If you want recommendations, it's always Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. 

If you want realistic plots and a hint of magic, Harry Potter's definitely the best. You get some good humour and tears from it too. I like how the plot is *so* delicately woven and how *"Always"*... bye, gonna cry.

On par is Percy Jackson. The series consists of *a lot of books*. The main series has 5, but there are two sequel series, each consisting of 5 books too. 

Not to mention the partner books and the supporting series about similar worlds in the same storyline.

Percy Jackson is mostly about Mythology. It's humorous and modern. You'll find that the characters actually talk like everyday teens, and there's a lot of laughs here. 

The plot is good, although not as delicate as Harry Potter, but it really compensates with the entertainment factor. 

## How I identify myself in terms of fandoms

I mean, it's impossible to be a teenager and not be in a fandom.

Harry Potter is of course the first fandom I've been a part of. I'm quite proud of the blue and bronze and the eagle of Ravenclaw, the house of the witty... and the not-so-witty, but those who treasure it.

As for being a Swiftie, it's easy: reputation. The best album of all time! In terms of lyrical masterpieces, I'd say Speak Now is a great album too, however some songs may be slow. I like the rock vibe and the lyrics.

My favourite song? That'd be... uh... every song. I can't choose. But it's undeniable that All Too Well is her best masterpiece.

How about Percy Jackson? What's my favourite god or goddess? My first choice would probably be Athena, goddess of wisdom and useful crafts as well as war and strategy, being a Ravenclaw, but the *war* thing won't work well for me.

I think I prefer Apollo - the god of music, poetry, healing, and a bunch of other stuff. I don't quite like the *god of bachelors* bit nor do I care about the *sun* bit, but music and poetry? Definitely!

## Social media

No, I'm not a social media kind of person. More of the person who lurks, comments and reposts, then I end up deleting my posts for aesthetic purposes because I gave up on something.

Thus, I often work on the computer, so it's not exactly convenient for social media, is it? The best I can do is edit some Unsplash stuff or go on Canva and design some posts.

## Wrapping up

That's all. I don't know what else you want to know. Now you know my fanbases and all...

Yeah. Bye. And if you're asking for my real name, forget it.
