Yeah, well, most 14 year olds don't make their own personal websites (that aren't for school of course)... but I do (I do...), and it's for random purposes.

It's a long story, really. You might want to look at my GitHub repository for diffs and the history of this website - oh wait, it's set to private! But anyways, I think I can tell you about this website.

Well, I was just going about my business making Discord Bots (don't ask) and wanted to put something in an archive. I wanted to put a really long rant or a full list of Taylor Swift-related links.

I went to Glitch and made a static website. I stole the Markdown CSS for GitHub and used it as my website's CSS... and so I wrote all the links.

Maybe there are a few gaps there, but at any rate I went to W3Schools and found a convenient template now used as my homepage.

With just a bit more CSS and research, I made it 'mine'. Then I decided to add my own links into the homepage, using simple scripts, stolen from the internet. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
            window.location.replace("https://discord.gg/k7suxQ4e9M")
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Yes, real programmers steal stuff a lot. I mean, I *do* understand what this code does, y'know. So it's okay.

Oh, and yeah, I think my headers used to bounce on hover. Gave up on that though. Also, I did *not* steal that part, thanks for asking. But then I decided that would take up too much work.

So I added more stuff to my archive. Hurray. But I found it bothersome that I must write in HTML *every single time*. HTML is a pain when writing stuff.

I wanted to use Markdown...

I discovered how Glitch uses 11ty (Eleventy) to make static sites. It's just like Jekyll, only JavaScript.

So naturally, I used it. At first it was great. I wrote in Markdown and got an HTML running site. But one day the website stopped working. Real bummer.

Months later, I dreamed. I wanted to keep on making my archive. But I was no expert on JavaScript; Python was my thing. So I went and spent several weeks - maybe around two? - making this masterpiece.

Of course, I made tons of changes. But here I am now. I made HTML templates, used Python to read my Markdown files, then wrote them into a folder as HTML, via Python-Markdown. Python-Markdown does all the converting. But I do the handling. I add some functions, variables, and meta into my code and such. That's a pain.

Also, thanks to everyone on... ah, many websites and forums. To Devcord, the best help there is, and any support forum like Stack Overflow and developer websites like Geeks For Geeks and W3Schools. What? I probably shouldn't give them credit, but there you go. Developers search Google on a minute-to-minute basis!

And after that, I redesigned my website.

My website used to look something like this:

But now? I wanted a dark mode that felt more like *me*.

It. Is. Beautiful. And I love it. And there's more to come soon. Every day, I'm gonna update this thing till it fits in with any of your other websites.

So... yeah. Bye!
