Really, why can't Instagram be like Twitter?

So I'm one of those few people who barely use their phones and mostly use their computer. And really, I can do almost everything and _more_ on computer, but Instagram just freaking nags you to use the phone.

> What if that person's files are on PC? What if that person uses Insta for businesses and has all of their files on their computer? This is so annoying!

Like legit.

## The many workarounds

So first of all, I usually use my computer. Then I want to post something on Instagram for something, then end up having to go to BlueStacks just to post something on Instagram. Suddenly my computer crashes because of BlueStacks.

Or maybe I find a really good Instagram extension. Then either my account gets hacked or it doesn't work properly.

Or I actually get the perfect extension called [Inssist](https://inssist.com) and it's amazing. But when I switch to my private account, it tells me that you can't really use Inssist because you need a business account - and that won't work with a private account.

Or you use the [Inspect element workaround](../insta-web) without installing anything, but you don't get access to all the good features.

Total bummer.

## The problem with workarounds

My favourite workaround is the [Inspect element workaround](../insta-web). You don't need to install anything, and you only need _three clicks_ to start posting.

But here's the catch: you _still_ don't have access to all those features. Like wth!?

This workaround basically allows you to use Insta web as if you're on your mobile, meaning you still don't get all the amazing app features. I really wonder why not put all the Insta app features onto web. Seriously, surely it's so simple to put those features into the web?

You can post, but you can't post carousels. You can add to your story, but you'll need a file and you can only have one story. What good is that? You can't even make those story collections.

What a disappointment.

## Twitter comparison

Switch to Twitter and everything's legit so easy. You could just copy/paste images from the internet and go post it right from your browser - no installs needed!

In Twitter, basically everything on the app is available on web. You don't need to do _anything_. And this is what Instagram is really lacking.

**NOTE 23 Jul 2024: Instagram has changed since so that it works fine on web. I also no longer care about Instagram nor Twitter. Also Twitter is now called X, but that's such a dumb name so it's still Twitter to me.**
