A virus physically destructs your body. It gives you fevers and cough. It kills people within weeks. It multiplies and spreads and kills more people.

But COVID-19 isn't just a virus. It doesn't just affect the people it infects nor the families it tears from killing its hosts. It's the mental effect on those around the world and those who have to do safety precautions.

In other words, the virus can kill you... even if it doesn't touch anyone around you. Even if the nearest person with the virus is a kilometre away. 

## Mental health vs physical health... or both

The safety precautions are there for a reason, and even though mental health is important, the deaths cannot be ignored. But at what cost?

People are often divided as to whether you want to go to physical work or stay at home. But staying at home is really unhealthy. Like people say, *sitting down is the new smoking*.

I go to online school every day, and let me tell you: it's bad. Do you know how stifling it is to stay at home, when I miss the simple pleasures of walking to class? Worrying about being late and walking faster? Eating at break with my friends?

I would even trade in the teasing for a chance to be back there.

People start getting really fat nowadays, because of the lack of activity. I mean, exercising at home is pretty awkward, isn't it? Thus, I had to take medicine for my Vitamin D levels, because of my lack of sunlight.

But it's not just that. It's also the mental health and the depressing circumstances. We never see our friends face-to-face anymore.

## The virus itself

But then again, there's the risk of catching the virus. But it makes you wonder: would you rather have serious mental health problems or be infected by a deadly virus? 

You also have to consider the fact that when you have the virus, you affect everyone else around you too. You'll be quarantined - probably worse than staying at home, since you can't see even your own family for two weeks. For perspective, two weeks is half a month.

And if you tested positive, there's a small - but not impossible - chance you'll die. You might be one of the small percentage who die of the virus. Anything is possible.

## Conclusion

I'm not saying we should prioritise mental health over the virus - in contrary, I prioritise the virus over mental health. But I think that we're actually more affected by the mental health issues than the actual virus. That and our weight gaining.

Haha bye.
