      <description>I was using Firefox&amp;rsquo;s reading mode on my site one day and thought some stuff looked off. Then I remembered: semantic elements. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why my site sometimes looks weird in reading mode!</description>

      <description>From what I figure, apparently there was something called Geocities back in the mid-90s to the 2000s. People joined online &amp;lsquo;cities&amp;rsquo; and made personal websites.&#xA;One of the things people would add into their sites were these 88x31 images, which sometimes contained links.</description>

      <description>Back in 2021, I used to have this website called anotherrr.web.app, made with a Static Site Generator I made myself. Due to the horrible codebase, it has since become adandoned. But I&amp;rsquo;m still quite fond of the content I wrote for it and wish to give those old posts a new home in this site.</description>

      <description>Short answer: why not?&#xA;The longer answer is me waxing poetic.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve made a website long long ago, back in 2021. (In fact, you can still see what remains of it here.</description>

      <description>What? Why did you click on that link?&#xA;ðŸ¤” I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what you think you&amp;rsquo;ll find in here, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why you&amp;rsquo;re bothering to scroll down and read this content, why you&amp;rsquo;re still here reading this very sentence.</description>

      <description>Yeah, well, most 14 year olds don&amp;rsquo;t make their own personal websites (that aren&amp;rsquo;t for school of course)&amp;hellip; but I do (I do&amp;hellip;), and it&amp;rsquo;s for random purposes.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a long story, really.</description>
