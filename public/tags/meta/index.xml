      <description>From what I figure, apparently there was something called Geocities back in the mid-90s to the 2000s. People joined online &amp;lsquo;cities&amp;rsquo; and made personal websites.&#xA;One of the things people would add into their sites were these 88x31 images, which sometimes contained links.</description>

      <description>Back in 2021, I used to have this website called anotherrr.web.app, made with a Static Site Generator I made myself. Due to the horrible codebase, it has since become adandoned.

      <description>Short answer: why not?&#xA;The longer answer is me waxing poetic.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve made a website long long ago, back in 2021. (In fact, you can still see what remains of it here.</description>

      <description>Hi. Let&amp;rsquo;s see, my last post here was back in 28 Jan 2024. It&amp;rsquo;s been four months!&#xA;I just finished polishing it up yesterday with some minor design changes. With the publish of this post, I got rid of a lot of cringy unhinged text on the main pages.</description>
