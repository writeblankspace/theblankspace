<p>Everyone has a story, however weird or normal or so ordinary nobody would want to listen to it.</p>
<p>I would very much like to tell you a dramatic story - that I was self-taught, that I was poor, that my first guitar went through so many things, and tons of entertaining stories.</p>
<p>Alas, my story isn&rsquo;t like Taylor Swift&rsquo;s computer mechanic story. But here&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<h2 id="guitar-at-school">Guitar at school</h2>
<p>I thought it&rsquo;s cool to play guitar. So in school I enrolled for the extra-curricular activity (ECA) for guitar in year 6.</p>
<p>Yes, it was that simple.</p>
<p>The interesting bit was that we didn&rsquo;t learn chords. We were taught picking. We would press on the strings with only one finger - my preferred was my middle finger, since it&rsquo;s the longest - and strum it with our thumbs.</p>
<p>We played one note at a time. Our first song was called Ciranda; I had no idea what song that is, but I don&rsquo;t think that matters. We learned how to pick notes and play it quickly.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a guitar lesson, and I&rsquo;m too lazy to make any diagrams nor show you my guitar notes.</p>
<p>I was one of the faster learners. The ones who couldn&rsquo;t play as fast were given chords, which were seen as &rsquo;easier&rsquo;. But my mind was set that chords are hard.</p>
<p>We learned two songs picking notes, but the first song we used chords on was The Best Day Of My Life. It had two chords - G and D. I took the challenge and learned the G chord, which was quite complicated.</p>
<p>However, it was mostly hard lol. We only played one chord at a time with a strumming pattern D D X. We would alternate between G and D. One group played D, another played G (like me).</p>
<p>But even then it was hard for me just to position my fingers on the frets. Like, 4 fingers is a little too much, right?</p>
<h2 id="cornelia-street">Cornelia Street</h2>
<p>So, you might ask, what song did you <em>seriously</em> play on guitar? Like, all chords, and you sing along? Easy: Cornelia Street live in Paris, by Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>My parents told me to play it, along with a tutorial by for3v3rfaithful on YouTube. And wow, it was hard. And boring.</p>
<p>I procrastinated. I hated guitar after that&hellip;</p>
<p>Capo on 4th fret, with chords G, D/F#, Em7, and Cadd9. Oh, and a strumming pattern that&rsquo;s simply torture.</p>
<p>D UUD UUD DU</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse than you think. Then I had to <em>sing</em> along with it.</p>
<p>At that time, it was total torture. Thus, the guitar was bigger than I was used to at school&hellip; so my parents decided to get me a 3/4 guitar.</p>
<p>It was good.</p>
<p>Anyways, after that, there was a family reunion. There was a talent contest or something. I honestly don&rsquo;t care about that contest, but my parents insisted that I play Cornelia Street.</p>
<p>We had no less than, like, 25 takes or something. I only played the chorus (it was too hard to do the strumming pattern, and I knew no other strumming pattern other than the classic down strums. And that was boring), but I was often out of sync with the strumming and singing.</p>
<p>But in the end, I did it. Not-so-good quality, but I did it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the winners were my cousins, who played Coffee by Beabadobee on ukulele.</p>
<p>The ukulele is a really cute instrument, with a pleasant sound.</p>
<h2 id="playing-the-ukulele">Playing the ukulele</h2>
<p>Naturally, my parents wanted me to play ukulele - &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good opportunity!&rdquo;. I admit I was excited. And sure enough, it was <em>great</em>. I mean, seriously, C G Am F chords and you only need three fingers!</p>
<p>Sadly, I had to play Coffee - a song I didn&rsquo;t know with the hardest possible chords. I think it was A, Amaj7, Dmaj7 and  D7. The last two chords are barres, with the pinky so far away from the rest of the fingers.</p>
<p>I tell you, that is H-A-R-D.</p>
<p>Beginner playing barre chords? Forget it.</p>
<p>But I did learn Champagne Problems by Taylor Swift&hellip; it was ever so easy. With just four chords I could learn nearly anything!</p>
<p>I kind of gave up on Coffee and guitar. I played ukulele every so often (kind of urgh, kind of nice). I learned the barre B chords, which were actually somewhat easy.</p>
<p>I loved the ukulele. But sometimes I hated it.</p>
<p>I could play, like, almost any song with the strumming patter DDU UDU or DDU or DDD DU or&hellip; yeah you get the point. Basic strumming patterns everyone knows.</p>
<p>But D UUD UUD DU was forgotten for its difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="guitar-again">Guitar again</h2>
<p>So, how come I love guitar now? Well, my dad said I should learn guitar again, since I play the ukulele so good now. And the guitar is the best instrument to learn, better than the ukulele.</p>
<p>So I decided to play one of my favourite songs - I&rsquo;d Lie, an unreleased song by Taylor Swift (what? I&rsquo;m a swiftie!). It was a little hard at first, but slowly I started shifting from ukulele to guitar. It sounded infinitely better.</p>
<p>I started playing tons of Taylor&rsquo;s songs after that. The ukulele now looks like a mini guitar with a high sound, with only four strings. It still looks cute though, and it sounds great, but I prefer guitar.</p>
<p>Thing is, I struggled with the barre chords. A ukulele F didn&rsquo;t have a barre (although B does), and guitars have 6 strings.</p>
<p>I mostly stuck to non-barre songs, adding the capo where necessary.</p>
<p>One of my favourite songs were Beautiful Eyes, I&rsquo;d Lie and Our Song. I took time learning the strumming pattern (d d D du), but like Cornelia Street, it was difficult. So I tried a different tactic - playing along with the recordings.</p>
<p>I played guitar and sang along with the vocals. And it proved effective. I also tried it with Fifteen, which uses the Cornelia Street strumming pattern. Then suddenly I mastered it.</p>
<p>Overtime, I also learned barre chords; it&rsquo;s still a bit buzzy, but it works for me.</p>
<p>I love guitar now haha.</p>
