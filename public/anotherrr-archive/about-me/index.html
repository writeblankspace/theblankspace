<p>That image is from Unsplash. It&rsquo;s not mine and I don&rsquo;t drink coffee. I don&rsquo;t use earphones (I prefer listening straight from the speakers) but I do like music. My keyboard is black and I prefer dotted grid notebooks to lined paper.</p>
<p>*takes a deeps breath* Yeah, just a disclaimer. You might get the wrong thing about me or something.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies!</h2>
<p>I think Hobbies mostly define you and the things you like. Well, I have a lot of hobbies.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that my biggest hobbies are development (computer programming - don&rsquo;t think of a stereotypical mechanic or a microsoft dev or&hellip; I&rsquo;ll explain later), reading and writing, and I read a lot.</p>
<p>I also enjoy listening to music, especially Taylor Swift, and I can play the guitar and the ukulele.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Alright, I should probably explain. From everything I&rsquo;ve heard, people either think I&rsquo;m a computer mechanic or a person who types nonstop into a green-and-black screen and hacks random people.</p>
<p>*Cough cough* <em>please</em>, I&rsquo;m currently fourteen and those are all <em>such</em> stereotypes. I do not fix computers, though my computer might bug every so often and I&rsquo;ll have to fix it myself, but I don&rsquo;t bother with wires.</p>
<p>Also, green on black hurts. I don&rsquo;t type nonsense into my code editor, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how my editor looks like. This code is part of what makes this website (where I write my articles in markdown and I use templates, variables and functions to customise my website):</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/luHbTd0.png" alt="Visual Studio Code editor"></p>
<p>As for those who <em>do</em> know about development, you&rsquo;ll find that I seem to use Python a lot. I prefer it to JavaScript, for the obvious reason: I&rsquo;m tired of iteration syntax and semicolons and <em>so many brackets</em>.</p>
<p>I prefer Python, where all you gotta do is use a colon and an indent. It looks nice too.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you might want to look at this article: <a href="../why-learn-py">Why Python is better than JavaScript</a>.</p>
<h2 id="music-and-literature">Music and literature</h2>
<p>Music, poetry, and books. The three best things in the world. I like writing songs, and if I can&rsquo;t write a song, it&rsquo;s going to be a poem.</p>
<p>I also love literature; I write a lot of stories, especially on Wattpad, although writers&rsquo; block strikes often and I just give up.</p>
<p>I can play the guitar and the uke as mentioned earlier. I often play Taylor Swift (duh). As of now, I&rsquo;m still struggling to make my barres sound nice on guitar, but I manage to make it sound even with the buzzing.</p>
<p>As for reading&hellip; what else can I say? Proud Potterhead and I&rsquo;m  becoming a Rick Riordan fan as well.</p>
<p>I usually like mysteries, and I like teen fantasies (the ones that say fairies are vain, not that they carry wands. Read Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them - it says it all!).</p>
<p>Good cries and really complicated plots also get me.</p>
<p>Aside from the two major fanbases, I also like Hunger Games (good cries there ToT) and I also read Jacqueline Wilson.</p>
<p>I used to read lots of Enid Blyton too; they&rsquo;re often childish and unrealistic, but they&rsquo;re entertaining as a whole, especially with mysteries.</p>
<p>Other stuff I like are Wonder (about a kid with a deformity - it&rsquo;s really good!), Molly Moon (hypnotism is the best) and The Land Of Stories (fairytales in real life, but I&rsquo;ve outgrown it).</p>
<h2 id="harry-potter-and-percy-jackson">Harry Potter and Percy Jackson</h2>
<p>If you want recommendations, it&rsquo;s always Harry Potter and Percy Jackson.</p>
<p>If you want realistic plots and a hint of magic, Harry Potter&rsquo;s definitely the best. You get some good humour and tears from it too. I like how the plot is <em>so</em> delicately woven and how <em>&ldquo;Always&rdquo;</em>&hellip; bye, gonna cry.</p>
<p>On par is Percy Jackson. The series consists of <em>a lot of books</em>. The main series has 5, but there are two sequel series, each consisting of 5 books too.</p>
<p>Not to mention the partner books and the supporting series about similar worlds in the same storyline.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson is mostly about Mythology. It&rsquo;s humorous and modern. You&rsquo;ll find that the characters actually talk like everyday teens, and there&rsquo;s a lot of laughs here.</p>
<p>The plot is good, although not as delicate as Harry Potter, but it really compensates with the entertainment factor.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-identify-myself-in-terms-of-fandoms">How I identify myself in terms of fandoms</h2>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s impossible to be a teenager and not be in a fandom.</p>
<p>Harry Potter is of course the first fandom I&rsquo;ve been a part of. I&rsquo;m quite proud of the blue and bronze and the eagle of Ravenclaw, the house of the witty&hellip; and the not-so-witty, but those who treasure it.</p>
<p>As for being a Swiftie, it&rsquo;s easy: reputation. The best album of all time! In terms of lyrical masterpieces, I&rsquo;d say Speak Now is a great album too, however some songs may be slow. I like the rock vibe and the lyrics.</p>
<p>My favourite song? That&rsquo;d be&hellip; uh&hellip; every song. I can&rsquo;t choose. But it&rsquo;s undeniable that All Too Well is her best masterpiece.</p>
<p>How about Percy Jackson? What&rsquo;s my favourite god or goddess? My first choice would probably be Athena, goddess of wisdom and useful crafts as well as war and strategy, being a Ravenclaw, but the <em>war</em> thing won&rsquo;t work well for me.</p>
<p>I think I prefer Apollo - the god of music, poetry, healing, and a bunch of other stuff. I don&rsquo;t quite like the <em>god of bachelors</em> bit nor do I care about the <em>sun</em> bit, but music and poetry? Definitely!</p>
<h2 id="social-media">Social media</h2>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a social media kind of person. More of the person who lurks, comments and reposts, then I end up deleting my posts for aesthetic purposes because I gave up on something.</p>
<p>Thus, I often work on the computer, so it&rsquo;s not exactly convenient for social media, is it? The best I can do is edit some Unsplash stuff or go on Canva and design some posts.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all. I don&rsquo;t know what else you want to know. Now you know my fanbases and all&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah. Bye. And if you&rsquo;re asking for my real name, forget it.</p>
