<p>Really, why can&rsquo;t Instagram be like Twitter?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m one of those few people who barely use their phones and mostly use their computer. And really, I can do almost everything and <em>more</em> on computer, but Instagram just freaking nags you to use the phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if that person&rsquo;s files are on PC? What if that person uses Insta for businesses and has all of their files on their computer? This is so annoying!</p>

<p>Like legit.</p>

<h2 id="the-many-workarounds">The many workarounds</h2>
<p>So first of all, I usually use my computer. Then I want to post something on Instagram for something, then end up having to go to BlueStacks just to post something on Instagram. Suddenly my computer crashes because of BlueStacks.</p>
<p>Or maybe I find a really good Instagram extension. Then either my account gets hacked or it doesn&rsquo;t work properly.</p>
<p>Or I actually get the perfect extension called <a href="https://inssist.com">Inssist</a> and it&rsquo;s amazing. But when I switch to my private account, it tells me that you can&rsquo;t really use Inssist because you need a business account - and that won&rsquo;t work with a private account.</p>
<p>Or you use the <a href="../insta-web">Inspect element workaround</a> without installing anything, but you don&rsquo;t get access to all the good features.</p>
<p>Total bummer.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-workarounds">The problem with workarounds</h2>
<p>My favourite workaround is the <a href="../insta-web">Inspect element workaround</a>. You don&rsquo;t need to install anything, and you only need <em>three clicks</em> to start posting.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the catch: you <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t have access to all those features. Like wth!?</p>
<p>This workaround basically allows you to use Insta web as if you&rsquo;re on your mobile, meaning you still don&rsquo;t get all the amazing app features. I really wonder why not put all the Insta app features onto web. Seriously, surely it&rsquo;s so simple to put those features into the web?</p>
<p>You can post, but you can&rsquo;t post carousels. You can add to your story, but you&rsquo;ll need a file and you can only have one story. What good is that? You can&rsquo;t even make those story collections.</p>
<p>What a disappointment.</p>
<h2 id="twitter-comparison">Twitter comparison</h2>
<p>Switch to Twitter and everything&rsquo;s legit so easy. You could just copy/paste images from the internet and go post it right from your browser - no installs needed!</p>
<p>In Twitter, basically everything on the app is available on web. You don&rsquo;t need to do <em>anything</em>. And this is what Instagram is really lacking.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 23 Jul 2024: Instagram has changed since so that it works fine on web. I also no longer care about Instagram nor Twitter. Also Twitter is now called X, but that&rsquo;s such a dumb name so it&rsquo;s still Twitter to me.</strong></p>
