<p>A virus physically destructs your body. It gives you fevers and cough. It kills people within weeks. It multiplies and spreads and kills more people.</p>
<p>But COVID-19 isn&rsquo;t just a virus. It doesn&rsquo;t just affect the people it infects nor the families it tears from killing its hosts. It&rsquo;s the mental effect on those around the world and those who have to do safety precautions.</p>
<p>In other words, the virus can kill you&hellip; even if it doesn&rsquo;t touch anyone around you. Even if the nearest person with the virus is a kilometre away.</p>
<h2 id="mental-health-vs-physical-health-or-both">Mental health vs physical health&hellip; or both</h2>
<p>The safety precautions are there for a reason, and even though mental health is important, the deaths cannot be ignored. But at what cost?</p>
<p>People are often divided as to whether you want to go to physical work or stay at home. But staying at home is really unhealthy. Like people say, <em>sitting down is the new smoking</em>.</p>
<p>I go to online school every day, and let me tell you: it&rsquo;s bad. Do you know how stifling it is to stay at home, when I miss the simple pleasures of walking to class? Worrying about being late and walking faster? Eating at break with my friends?</p>
<p>I would even trade in the teasing for a chance to be back there.</p>
<p>People start getting really fat nowadays, because of the lack of activity. I mean, exercising at home is pretty awkward, isn&rsquo;t it? Thus, I had to take medicine for my Vitamin D levels, because of my lack of sunlight.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just that. It&rsquo;s also the mental health and the depressing circumstances. We never see our friends face-to-face anymore.</p>
<h2 id="the-virus-itself">The virus itself</h2>
<p>But then again, there&rsquo;s the risk of catching the virus. But it makes you wonder: would you rather have serious mental health problems or be infected by a deadly virus?</p>
<p>You also have to consider the fact that when you have the virus, you affect everyone else around you too. You&rsquo;ll be quarantined - probably worse than staying at home, since you can&rsquo;t see even your own family for two weeks. For perspective, two weeks is half a month.</p>
<p>And if you tested positive, there&rsquo;s a small - but not impossible - chance you&rsquo;ll die. You might be one of the small percentage who die of the virus. Anything is possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying we should prioritise mental health over the virus - in contrary, I prioritise the virus over mental health. But I think that we&rsquo;re actually more affected by the mental health issues than the actual virus. That and our weight gaining.</p>
<p>Haha bye.</p>
