<p>What? Why did you click on that link?</p>
<p>ðŸ¤” I honestly don&rsquo;t know what you think you&rsquo;ll find in here, but it&rsquo;s definitely not what you&rsquo;re looking for. I don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;re bothering to scroll down and read this content, why you&rsquo;re still here reading this very sentence.</p>
<p>Huh, you&rsquo;re insufferable, did you know that? Guess what, I inserted a script in this thing that will crash your computer!</p>
<p>Good luck surviving that. I bet you&rsquo;re still loading and it will never stop until your browser stops.</p>
<p>Any minute now&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>No, why would I put those things on my website?</p>
<ol>
<li>that would crash <em>my</em> computer</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m too dumb to make that</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s a trick for you: just add this bit of css to your website:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">loading</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#66d9ef">cursor</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">wait</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And any user who hovers over that thing will have a loading cursor! If you inspect the elements here, you&rsquo;ll find an inline CSS in the HTML script making your cursor load. It&rsquo;s not really loading anything. It&rsquo;s just a cursor. But it <em>does</em> tend to trigger people.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 23 Jul 2024: I was much younger when I wrote this. This was extremely cringe and it will definitely leave you confused. I had put that CSS snippet into the original website, but I am currently too lazy to put it back in. Heh.</strong></p>
