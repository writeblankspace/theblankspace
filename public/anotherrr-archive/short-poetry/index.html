<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me&hellip; you love vivid imagery stored in writing. You find beauty in dip pens, ink, and old yellowed paper. You can make a poem out of that.</p>
<p>Oh, and you like songs based on lyrics. Especially Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re here, you probably love writing. You like making worlds out of your imagination. So I&rsquo;m going to share something I learned in a windy December.</p>

<h2 id="auroras-and-sad-prose">Auroras and sad prose</h2>
<p>A quick Google search of this <em>The Lakes</em> lyric told me what proses are:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lsysrmD.png" alt="Google Search of Prose meaning"></p>
<p>According to Google, proses are &ldquo;<em>written or spoken language in its ordinary form, without metrical structure</em>&rdquo;. So basically, they&rsquo;re ordinary english with no poetry whatsoever.</p>
<p>But sad prose? Well, I think I have an idea of what it means.</p>
<p>Once, I attended a writers&rsquo; workshop. A teacher told us about how you can write a whole story in jsut a sentence, and it changed my life.</p>
<p>Take this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FOR SALE</strong> <br />
Wedding dress <br />
never worn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can look at it for a while. Okay, there&rsquo;s a wedding dress. It&rsquo;s for sale and was never worn. It can mean anything.</p>
<p>Then you ask, <em>why?</em> You can interpret that any way you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not explicit after all, but in my opinion the answer to the <em>why?</em> is a tragedy. There are no right or wrong answers, but I saw this as a girl who was about to get married. Then her fiance left her&hellip; and then she was never wed.</p>
<p>Woah. That went deep. Other people thought the girl died. Others thought nothing of it and a guy just wants to sell a wedding dress on ebay.</p>
<p>But that changed my perspective. Let&rsquo;s move on to another topic - one of my favourites!</p>
<h2 id="haikuuusss">Haikuuusss!</h2>
<p>A classic Japanese poem with no rhymes and consists of three lines. The first line has 5 syllables, the second 7, and the last 5 again. And it&rsquo;s the best type of poem in my opinion.</p>
<p>Poems are often descriptive and written in old english and whatnot. They consist of flowery metaphors and long hard words. But what I like about haikus are that they&rsquo;re so <em>simple</em> and that&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>Ignore the haikus in Percy Jackson; they&rsquo;re not just about the syllables, but they&rsquo;re about the nature of the poems.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see an example from <a href="https://www.readpoetry.com/10-vivid-haikus-to-leave-you-breathless/">the first result in Google</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Old Pond&rdquo; by Matsuo Basho</strong> <br />
an old silent pond <br />
a frog jumps into the pond - <br />
splash! silence again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m too lazy to keep browsing, but I like this poem. It&rsquo;s written in such simple words that anyone can understand it. And yet it&rsquo;s simply beautiful.</p>
<p>The simplicity really takes you into the poems. It&rsquo;s like a tranquil little scene. You&rsquo;re surrounded by nature, as most haikus are set in.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another poem from a <a href="https://bucketlistjourney.net/how-to-write-a-haiku-poem/">cool detailed article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Untitled</em> by Ryokan Taigu</strong> <br />
in the autumn wind <br />
standing alone <br />
a shadow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now you probably get the idea. Some of them have verbs and simple adjectives, but I like how they use just a noun in a single line.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one I wrote on the spot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Morning Rain&rdquo; by yours truly</strong> <br />
the patter of rain <br />
teardrops on my windowsill <br />
a drizzly morning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those people who love rain and the smell of rain&hellip; but not puddles and mud. But rain definitely takes about 10% of all my poetry.</p>
<h2 id="simple-words">Simple words</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know similies and metaphors and whatnot to make your poetry and writing beautiful. If you have a vivid mind&rsquo;s eye and you can translate it into effective words, you can write beautiful things.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s usually the plain words that make me cry my eyeballs out. By saying plainly that my favourite character is <em>dead</em> - ouch, that&rsquo;s like a dagger to the chest.</p>
<p>I think you should try writing these yourself! Thanks for reading &lt;3.</p>
