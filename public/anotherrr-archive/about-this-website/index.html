<p>Yeah, well, most 14 year olds don&rsquo;t make their own personal websites (that aren&rsquo;t for school of course)&hellip; but I do (I do&hellip;), and it&rsquo;s for random purposes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long story, really. You might want to look at my GitHub repository for diffs and the history of this website - oh wait, it&rsquo;s set to private! But anyways, I think I can tell you about this website.</p>
<p>Well, I was just going about my business making Discord Bots (don&rsquo;t ask) and wanted to put something in an archive. I wanted to put a really long rant or a full list of Taylor Swift-related links.</p>
<p>I went to Glitch and made a static website. I stole the Markdown CSS for GitHub and used it as my website&rsquo;s CSS&hellip; and so I wrote all the links.</p>
<p>Maybe there are a few gaps there, but at any rate I went to W3Schools and found a convenient template now used as my homepage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TxDM2sG.jpg" alt="ItzJean Homepage"></p>
<p>With just a bit more CSS and research, I made it &lsquo;mine&rsquo;. Then I decided to add my own links into the homepage, using simple scripts, stolen from the internet.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">script</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            window.<span style="color:#a6e22e">location</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">replace</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://discord.gg/k7suxQ4e9M&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">script</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yes, real programmers steal stuff a lot. I mean, I <em>do</em> understand what this code does, y&rsquo;know. So it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Oh, and yeah, I think my headers used to bounce on hover. Gave up on that though. Also, I did <em>not</em> steal that part, thanks for asking. But then I decided that would take up too much work.</p>
<p>So I added more stuff to my archive. Hurray. But I found it bothersome that I must write in HTML <em>every single time</em>. HTML is a pain when writing stuff.</p>
<p>I wanted to use Markdown&hellip;</p>
<p>I discovered how Glitch uses 11ty (Eleventy) to make static sites. It&rsquo;s just like Jekyll, only JavaScript.</p>
<p>So naturally, I used it. At first it was great. I wrote in Markdown and got an HTML running site. But one day the website stopped working. Real bummer.</p>
<p>Months later, I dreamed. I wanted to keep on making my archive. But I was no expert on JavaScript; Python was my thing. So I went and spent several weeks - maybe around two? - making this masterpiece.</p>
<p>Of course, I made tons of changes. But here I am now. I made HTML templates, used Python to read my Markdown files, then wrote them into a folder as HTML, via Python-Markdown. Python-Markdown does all the converting. But I do the handling. I add some functions, variables, and meta into my code and such. That&rsquo;s a pain.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to everyone on&hellip; ah, many websites and forums. To Devcord, the best help there is, and any support forum like Stack Overflow and developer websites like Geeks For Geeks and W3Schools. What? I probably shouldn&rsquo;t give them credit, but there you go. Developers search Google on a minute-to-minute basis!</p>
<p>And after that, I redesigned my website.</p>
<p>My website used to look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pdgUWTA.png" alt="Old Website Design"></p>
<p>But now? I wanted a dark mode that felt more like <em>me</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1VwTZt6.png" alt="New Website Design"></p>
<p>It. Is. Beautiful. And I love it. And there&rsquo;s more to come soon. Every day, I&rsquo;m gonna update this thing till it fits in with any of your other websites.</p>
<p>So&hellip; yeah. Bye!</p>
