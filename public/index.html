	<p>Heyyoooo cyber-traveller!</p>
<p>Welcome to the blog of <a href="https://infosec.space/@writeblankspace">yours truly</a>. I post the most random stuff here, especially those that are so long or so obnoxious it will likely just fill the Mastodon feeds with my ramblings.</p>
<p>I feel obligated to give you couple of warnings: please tread carefully on these treacherous grounds as you do not know what unhinged idiocy you shall encounter in these uh&hellip; posts. You have been warned.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, have a good day. You will likely be seeing a lot of posts regarding my current obsessions (such as music, literature, linguistics, other arts, programming, etc). Please do <em>not</em> consider any of this content, by any means, true — and rather, just some random text typed up by a teenager who isn&rsquo;t really bothered to do any research or fact-checking or even referencing because all this mostly just goes straight out of my head and into a text editor.</p>
<p>For more meta, I suggest you see my <a href="posts/about/">About page</a>.</p>

			I dunno who&rsquo;d be interested enough to view this page — or heck, even this website — but if you truly are curious then feel free to scroll through all this meta stuff.
Read on if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about&hellip;
&hellip;yours truly, a.k.a. me Heyy I usually go about the username writeblankspace (seemed a really cool username, like &ldquo;write&rdquo; and then a blank space where I could write stuff — also Blank Space teehee) but you might find that I tend to change my display name.

			I&rsquo;m just starting out and making this cool new Hugo website as a blog teehee. This is called My First Post because that&rsquo;s what the quickstart told me to call it :D.
If this post appears a little weird to you, I suggest changing either your browser (get out Internet Explorer) or your browser&rsquo;s default sans serif font. I made this website as minimal as possible while still adding my own flair to it.
