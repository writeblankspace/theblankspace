<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about <em>me</em>, see my <a href="/">home page</a> or visit some of my links there. If you want to learn more about this website itself, read on.</p>

<h2 id="what-goes-here">What goes here?</h2>
<p>This website is a lovely place where I might put random thoughts, random works, yapping, stuff I want to share as a link, or streams of consciousness that lead to impulsive writing and publishing.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-make-it">How did you make it?</h2>
<p>I wrote this website in HTML and CSS and the content is written in markdown before everything is generated into a static site with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>The contents and the design of this website are written entirely by me.</p>
<h2 id="why-make-a-website">Why make a website?</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a very interesting question that will lead to a <em>lot</em> of yapping and waxing poetic, so it has <a href="/posts/why-i-made-a-website">its own dedicated post</a>!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-aims-of-this-website">What are the aims of this website?</h2>
<p>This website is for housing and hosting and publishing whatever I want to put in it. However, I did set myself some goals as to what I want the site to <em>be like</em>. The main things I want to achieve with this website are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: This website is functional and shows all its posts. Yay.</li>
<li><strong>No bloat</strong>: I was quite inspired by the <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">mfing website</a>. Websites are responsive and actually quite beautiful by default. Why change that? While I&rsquo;m not ditching CSS altogether, I aim to stick to the defaults as much as possible and add my own design elements where it improves the look and feel.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: There are little things anybody could do to make a website more accessible, whether it&rsquo;s to those with visual impairments, slow internet connection, or whatever. I want to try my best to ensure accessibility in this little personal site.</li>
<li><strong>Personalisation</strong>: I <a href="/posts/why-i-made-a-website">once waxed poetic</a> on how your personal website was a manifestation of yourself, made with your heart and soul. That rings true for me on here. All elements of this websie feel like <em>me</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code of this website is available on its <a href="https://github.com/writeblankspace/theblankspace">GitHub page</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to view the older source of my website or take some inspiration or code snippets, feel free to do so!</p>
<h2 id="some-final-words">Some final words</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially all I can tell you about myself and this website without going off on a tangent. If you would like to go down those tangents, view my <a href="/posts/">posts</a>!</p>
