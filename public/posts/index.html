	<p>All my posts, all out for you to see. Everytime I post something here it&rsquo;s like sending letters to the void and someone can come see them and read them.</p>

	Hi. Let&rsquo;s see, my last post here was back in 28 Jan 2024. It&rsquo;s been four months!
I just finished polishing it up yesterday with some minor design changes. With the publish of this post, I got rid of a lot of cringy unhinged text on the main pages. The posts remain unchanged except for an update on my Fediverse handle.
As of right now, Fedirings aren&rsquo;t working. For some reason my emails never end up making the issue on their tracker.

	I dunno who&rsquo;d be interested enough to view this page — or heck, even this website — but if you truly are curious then feel free to scroll through all this meta stuff.
Read on if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about&hellip;
&hellip;yours truly, a.k.a. me Heyy I usually go about the username writeblankspace (seemed a really cool username, like &ldquo;write&rdquo; and then a blank space where I could write stuff — also Blank Space teehee) but you might find that I tend to change my display name.

	<h2><a href="/posts/my-first-post/">My First Post</a></h2>
	I&rsquo;m just starting out and making this cool new Hugo website as a blog teehee. This is called My First Post because that&rsquo;s what the quickstart told me to call it :D.
If this post appears a little weird to you, I suggest changing either your browser (get out Internet Explorer) or your browser&rsquo;s default sans serif font. I made this website as minimal as possible while still adding my own flair to it.
