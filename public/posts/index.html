	<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of all my posts. Same warnings as on the homepage apply. Hope you find what you are looking for&hellip; or not, because I do not wish you to be exposed to all the unhingedness included here.</p>
<p>Also, how on earth did you manage to get here? There aren&rsquo;t any links to this page!</p>

			I&rsquo;m just starting out and making this cool new Hugo website as a blog teehee. This is called My First Post because that&rsquo;s what the quickstart told me to call it :D.
If this post appears a little weird to you, I suggest changing either your browser (get out Internet Explorer) or your browser&rsquo;s default sans serif font. I made this website as minimal as possible while still adding my own flair to it.
