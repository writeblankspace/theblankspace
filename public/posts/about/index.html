<article>
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I dunno who&rsquo;d be interested enough to view this page — or heck, even this website — but if you truly are curious then feel free to scroll through all this meta stuff.</p>
<p>Read on if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="yours-truly-me">&hellip;yours truly (me)</h3>
<p>I usually go about the username writeblankspace (seemed a really cool username, like &ldquo;write&rdquo; and then a blank space where I could write stuff — also Blank Space because yeah) but you might find that I tend to change my display name. I like staying anonymous online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in a ton of things. I like music and tech. I often end up in rabbit holes about mythology, linguistics or such.</p>
<p>My current obsession changes a lot, but I find myself falling back to the same hobbies every so often.</p>
<p>As said by a wise woman once, &ldquo;Embrace the cringe&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m <em>embracing the cringe</em>. That might lead to a lot of unhingedness, but in a world that craves perfection (and, in that quest to perfection, misses the entire point), who needs hinges? Be what you are.</p>
<p>My main language is English, but my native tongue is Tagalog. Most (if not all) of the posts on this site are most likely going to be in English.</p>
<h3 id="the-website">&hellip;the website</h3>
<p>This website is a lovely place where my brain cells go to rest. It was made with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, an amazing static site generator.</p>
<p>The contents and the design of this website are written entirely by me.</p>
<p>The main things I want to achieve with this website:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: This website is functional and shows all its posts. Yay.</li>
<li><strong>No bloat</strong>: I was quite inspired by the <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">mfing website</a>. Websites are responsive and actually quite beautiful by default. Why change that? While I&rsquo;m not ditching CSS altogether, I aim to stick to the defaults as much as possible and add my own design elements where it improves the look and feel.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: There are little things anybody could do to make a website more accessible, whether it&rsquo;s to those with visual impairments, slow internet connection, or whatever.</li>
<li><strong>Personalisation</strong>: I <a href="../why-i-made-a-website">once waxed poetic</a> on how your personal website was a manifestation of yourself, made with your heart and soul. That rings true for me on here. All elements of this websie feel like <em>me</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code of this website is available on its <a href="https://github.com/writeblankspace/theblankspace">GitHub page</a>. If there are any issues, go ahead and make some. Take heed: I may not see it for the next 6 months. Or ever. Y&rsquo;know, just so you&rsquo;re aware.</p>
<h3 id="whatever-else">&hellip;whatever else</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially all I can tell you about myself and this website without going off on a tangent. If you would like to go down those tangents, view my <a href="/posts/">posts</a>!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 28 Jul 2024: so I edited this page a little bit to reflect my current self. Forgive me if the language seems kind of &lsquo;off&rsquo; because right now you&rsquo;re seeing two different phases of me on a single page. I did say <em>embrace the cringe</em> but some parts were just so cringy I had to lop them off. They&rsquo;re immortalised in the older git versions though!</strong></p>
