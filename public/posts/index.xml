      <description>Hey, this is just a little PSA for anyone who uses Hugo on their sites: make sure the purge public/ every so often!&#xA;One weird thing about Hugo is that it generates everything for you but, for some reason, it never checks whether or not something still exists.</description>

      <description>I was using Firefox&amp;rsquo;s reading mode on my site one day and thought some stuff looked off. Then I remembered: semantic elements. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why my site sometimes looks weird in reading mode!</description>

      <description>From what I figure, apparently there was something called Geocities back in the mid-90s to the 2000s. People joined online &amp;lsquo;cities&amp;rsquo; and made personal websites.&#xA;One of the things people would add into their sites were these 88x31 images, which sometimes contained links.</description>

      <description>Back in 2021, I used to have this website called anotherrr.web.app, made with a Static Site Generator I made myself. Due to the horrible codebase, it has since become adandoned. But I&amp;rsquo;m still quite fond of the content I wrote for it and wish to give those old posts a new home in this site.</description>

      <description>Short answer: why not?&#xA;The longer answer is me waxing poetic.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve made a website long long ago, back in 2021. (In fact, you can still see what remains of it here.</description>

      <description>You may have heard of the emerging social media platform Mastodon. If you happen to pay even more attention, you may have also heard of those called Misskey, Pixelfed, Peertube, and such.</description>

      <description>You might already know how to vibe-check users and instances as a Fediverse user. But there are tons of bad instances out there. A wee little user can&amp;rsquo;t mute/block/report &amp;rsquo;em all!</description>

      <description>Woohoo! You&amp;rsquo;re in your Fediverse instance, and&amp;hellip;&#xA;OH NO! You just saw something that makes you want to bleach your eyes, and rip them eyeballs out of their sockets, and bleach them again!</description>

      <description>Hi. Let&amp;rsquo;s see, my last post here was back in 28 Jan 2024. It&amp;rsquo;s been four months!&#xA;I just finished polishing it up yesterday with some minor design changes. With the publish of this post, I got rid of a lot of cringy unhinged text on the main pages.</description>
