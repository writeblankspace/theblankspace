	<h1>Vibe-checking in the Fediverse as a user</h1>
	<p>Woohoo! You&rsquo;re in your Fediverse instance, and&hellip;</p>
<p><em>OH NO!</em> You just saw something that makes you want to bleach your eyes, and rip them eyeballs out of their sockets, and bleach them again! Or perhaps a post so horrible, you&rsquo;re willing to write a rather colourful 10-paragraph explanation as to why their opinions are <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<div class="box">

<h2 id="our-scenario">Our scenario</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re in an instance called <strong>weLoveCats.hehe</strong>. Yes, I know that <code>.hehe</code> is not a valid TLD, but that&rsquo;s because our instance here is a fake one for the sake of example.</p>
<p>You <em>love</em> your instance! Most of its users are amazing. The admins are friendly. The moderators make sure the instance stays squeaky-clean of the bad stuff you don&rsquo;t want in there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t have perfection all the time. Some bad stuff still gets through occasionally.</p>
<p>NOTE: not sure how these apply to different Fediverse software, but they definitely work in Mastodon and Misskey.</p>
<h2 id="case-1-the-rando-you-just-dont-like-for-no-particular-reason">Case 1: the rando you just don&rsquo;t like for no particular reason</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re doomscrolling on cat pics again. And then&hellip; you see someone who said that they didn&rsquo;t like cats.</p>
<p>Hot take, huh? But they didn&rsquo;t mean any harm and didn&rsquo;t break any rules. Nonetheless, you want them <em>out</em> of your timeline.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can <strong>mute</strong> them!</p>
<p>You might even be able to set the duration of that mute, but at any rate, you can rest easy as you won&rsquo;t be seeing any of their posts unless they @mention you.</p>
<h2 id="case-2-the-meanie">Case 2: the meanie</h2>
<p>So you were browsing your feed and commenting on cat vids and someone slides into your profile and DMs you: &ldquo;what a miserable %$#@!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And it ruins your entire day. How dare they use such a slur!</p>
<p>You can mute them, but you might decide that you want something more forceful. Wipe them right out of your life!</p>
<p>Behold: the <strong>block</strong>.</p>
<p>You can block this user and thus you won&rsquo;t be able to see any of their posts or interactions with you. You won&rsquo;t be able to see anyone&rsquo;s replies to them. They will be removed from your followers. They won&rsquo;t be notified of you blocking them.</p>
<h2 id="case-3-the-rule-breaker">Case 3: the rule-breaker</h2>
<p>But wait! A user like that&hellip; saying a slur like that&hellip; you don&rsquo;t think they should be anywhere near your server!</p>
<p>You can <strong>report</strong> this user to your server moderators. They can decide what to do from there, whatever it is. If the user isn&rsquo;t from your instance, you can also choose to report them to <em>their</em> instance so <em>their</em> moderators can take action.</p>
<h2 id="case-4-the-bad-army">Case 4: the bad army</h2>
<p>Turns out, there are tons of randos you don&rsquo;t like for no particular reason. Or tons of meanies, or tons of rule-breakers.</p>
<p><em>And</em> they all happen to reside in the same instance called <strong>noCatsArmy.hehe</strong>. There seems to be a consistent pattern of that instance having users you just don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>You can do these actions for instances too! You can <strong>mute, block and report instances</strong> as needed.</p>
<h2 id="case-5-the-bad-words">Case 5: the bad words</h2>
<p>So your timelines are now free of horrible people. Yipee!</p>
<p>But one more thing still bugs you: you see lots of dog posts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge issue and it&rsquo;s not against the rules. But you wish you wouldn&rsquo;t see so many of them, and it&rsquo;s too spread out across so many users of so many instances. What can you do?</p>
<p>You can make <strong>filters</strong>. These filters allow you to make sure you don&rsquo;t see posts that might meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>How advanced these critera can be depends on your instance&rsquo;s software. Some might include AND/OR logic, and some can apply to instance names and user names. Some might only apply to the text in a post.</p>
<p>If all these dog posts annoy you, you might want to filter out the word &ldquo;dog&rdquo;, or perhaps go further and filter similar words like &ldquo;dogs&rdquo;, &ldquo;pup&rdquo;, &ldquo;puppy&rdquo;, &ldquo;puppies&rdquo; and such.</p>
<h2 id="some-final-words">Some final words</h2>
<p>And that&rsquo;s some things you can do as a user to make sure your timelines pass the vibe checks and you feel nice and chill in there!</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;re just a user&hellip; you might be able to keep the unscrupulous characters out of your front door, but it takes a good police force to keep them out of your neighbourhood (okay, not the best analogy but whatever). That&rsquo;s where your <a href="../how-your-instance-admins-can-vibe-check-other-instances-in-the-fediverse">instance admins and moderators come in</a>.</p>
