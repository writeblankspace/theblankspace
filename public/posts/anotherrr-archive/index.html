	<h1>Anotherrr Archive</h1>
	<p>I used to have this website called <a href="https://anotherrr.web.app">anotherrr.web.app</a>. Why are there so many &lsquo;r&rsquo;s, you ask? Because I thought calling it &ldquo;another web app&rdquo; would be quite funny, but that was taken. So I called it &ldquo;another random read&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;anotherrr&rdquo; for short.</p>
<p>The last time I touched it was in 2022. Imagine! But the time I actually used it was back when I was 14 (2021). I loved this website. Please be warned though: some of the views by younger me are no longer shared by my present self. There might also be some misinformation, as I wasn&rsquo;t much of a fact-checker. Don&rsquo;t cancel me pls..</p>
<p>It was made using a Static Site Generator&hellip; made by me, in Python. Yes, I tried to reinvent the wheel. That resulted in spaghetti code.</p>
<p>For some reason, all my posts disappeared from the actual website now. You&rsquo;ll still be able to get a glimpse of the site in its former glory from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210823070621/https://anotherrr.web.app/">the internet archive</a>&hellip; I&rsquo;m scrolling through it right now and I can&rsquo;t help but think: I really put in so much effort in there, huh?</p>
<p>However, going through the Internet Archive isn&rsquo;t the most reliable nor the fastest. So I decided to put all these old posts right here, in their new home. It doesn&rsquo;t have all the old fancy CSS, but the content is copy-pasted straight from 2021. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: these posts may contain several images and syntax-highlighted code snippets, so it&rsquo;s definitely a little heavier than my usual posts here.</strong></p>

	<p>That image is from Unsplash. It&rsquo;s not mine and I don&rsquo;t drink coffee. I don&rsquo;t use earphones (I prefer listening straight from the speakers) but I do like music. My keyboard is black and I prefer dotted grid notebooks to lined paper.</p>

	<p>A virus physically destructs your body. It gives you fevers and cough. It kills people within weeks. It multiplies and spreads and kills more people.
But COVID-19 isn&rsquo;t just a virus.</p>

	<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me&hellip; you love vivid imagery stored in writing. You find beauty in dip pens, ink, and old yellowed paper. You can make a poem out of that.</p>

	<p>Everyone has a story, however weird or normal or so ordinary nobody would want to listen to it.
I would very much like to tell you a dramatic story - that I was self-taught, that I was poor, that my first guitar went through so many things, and tons of entertaining stories.</p>

	<p>Really, why can&rsquo;t Instagram be like Twitter?
So I&rsquo;m one of those few people who barely use their phones and mostly use their computer. And really, I can do almost everything and more on computer, but Instagram just freaking nags you to use the phone.</p>

ü§î I honestly don&rsquo;t know what you think you&rsquo;ll find in here, but it&rsquo;s definitely not what you&rsquo;re looking for. I don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;re bothering to scroll down and read this content, why you&rsquo;re still here reading this very sentence.</p>

	<p>Yeah, well, most 14 year olds don&rsquo;t make their own personal websites (that aren&rsquo;t for school of course)&hellip; but I do (I do&hellip;), and it&rsquo;s for random purposes.
It&rsquo;s a long story, really.</p>
