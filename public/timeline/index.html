<p><q>Salt air and the rust on your door</q> amirite? Happy <em>folklore track 8</em> everyone!</p>
<h2 id="website-stuff">Website stuff</h2>
<p>The git repo should be a great way to tell you the most recent changes on my site, but let me tell you the most recent changes anyway. It&rsquo;s currently quarter to one, but some changes are small and easy to make.</p>
<ol>
<li>I fixed some links regarding the <a href="/about/">about page</a>, especially as the <code>public/</code> dir required purging and I forgot to do that yesterday.</li>
<li>Fixed more links! Yipee!</li>
<li>Put the three files regarding the <a href="/tags/fediverse">#fediverse</a> in order or writing, because I did not bother with their dates lol.</li>
<li>Used Netlify to build the site instead of building on my machine then pushing to GitHub and getting Netlify to just take <code>public/</code> from there, which causes the commit hashes to sometimes be outdates by a commit.</li>
</ol>
<p>I should probably also address the thing I forgot to say here yesterday: I really forgot it for good now. No telling what it might&rsquo;ve been, but oh well.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Personal life, huh? Well, here goes. Our iGCSE results will be released on 13 August, and everyone&rsquo;s anticipating that. To be honest, I quit caring so much about what grade I might get anymore. I probably won&rsquo;t fail. I just hope I get the minimum grades to get into the A-levels I want.</p>
<p>Quite worried about Computer Science because I actually did <em>not</em> try hard enough to learn any theory. Hopefully my excellent 15-mark-question algorithm in Python would make up for it though!</p>
<p>Some stuff about health: my right hand is <em>suffering</em>. It matches all the symptoms of dishydrosis and it sucks. It&rsquo;s ugly, it&rsquo;s itchy, it&rsquo;s [insert scream here]. Ugh.</p>
<h1 id="wed-31-jul-2024">Wed, 31 Jul 2024</h1>
<p>So today I decided to make a little timeline. I like posting stuff about this beloved website, but simply don&rsquo;t know whether to post it on Fedi or make a post about it here. As of writing, <a href="/tags/dev/">#dev</a> has the most posts (9), but <a href="/tags/meta/">#meta</a> is a running second (6). Surely there&rsquo;s got to be some place for all this meta without making actual posts on <code>/posts/</code>?</p>
<p>Recently, I got an interest for places like <a href="https://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>. I was browsing around some people&rsquo;s personal sites there and they&rsquo;re mostly timelines that just explain the status quo — a literal <em>web log</em>!</p>
<p>It excited me. I already signed up for an account there, but unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t recieved any updates, so I&rsquo;m back to here. Perhaps I will make the über-long page right here in my site then!</p>
<p>So yeah, this is the first log here. Hello.</p>
<p>Wait, I was gonna address something here before I did <code>hugo new content timeline.md</code>. Hmm, what was it?</p>
